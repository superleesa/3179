                <h1>Japan's Deflation</h1>
                <p>Japan has been grappling with <span style="color:red">deflation</span> for many years. Deflation is a
                    persistent decrease in the general price level of goods and services, and it can have various
                    economic consequences, including <span class="red">a decrease in demand and wages, and increase in
                        unemployement</span>.</p>
                <div style="width:100%;">
                    <h2>What is current Japan's deflation level?</h2>
                </div>
                <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often used as an economic indicator for inflation/deflation level,
                    which specifically measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and
                    services over time. The below chart shows the CPI for G7 countries in various sectors, such as food,
                    energy, transporation, clothing and communication. It clealy indicates a Japan's deflating trend,
                    where <span class="red">CPI values are not increasing and sometimes decreasing</span>, when other
                    countries sustain about 2 CPI units increase per year.</p>

            <div style="width:100%;">
                <h2 style="margin-top:60px;">What's causing and not causing the deflation?</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="flex-center">
                <div>
                    <h3>Fact1: Minimum wage is increasing</h3>
                    <p>Japan's government <span class="red">constantly elevates minimum wages</span>, optimized
                        prefecture-wise. Slide the slider to see the increasing minimum wage along the timeline.</p>
                    <div id="minimum_wage_map" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;"></div>
                </div>

                
                <div>
                    <h3>Fact2: Work producitivity is the lowest among G7 countries</h3>
                    <p>Economists argue that Japan's deflation is <span class="red">caused by its inability to be
                            productive and creative</span>, leading to non-increasing wages and product price levels.
                    </p>

            <div style="margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom:60px;width:100%;">
                <h3>Fact3: Average Wage is NOT increasing even slighly compared to other countries</h3>
                <p>The increasing minimum wage doesn't direcly correlate to Japan's average wage. When average wage is
                    low, people do not have adequate purchasing power, <span class="red">necessiating companies to
                        decrease porducts/services price level</span>. The below bump chart shows the <span
                        class="red">dropping ranking, from 5th to 20th</span>, in Japan's average wage compared to OECD
                    countries, from 2000 to 2022.</p>
